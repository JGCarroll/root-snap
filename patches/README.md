This folder contains patches that are applied to individual components during the Snap build.
It is absolutely not a goal to upstream these patches.
They may be considered ugly and rely on behaviour that wouldn't be acceptible outside of a snap runtime environment.

They should be considered to have the license of their respective upstream projects.
